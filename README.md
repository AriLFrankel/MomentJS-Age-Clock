# MomentJS Age Clock
An exercise in reading the MomentJS documentation to accompany a documentation lecture

## High Level Goal for this Activity
The goal of this activity is for you to put in to practice the principles of effectively navigating documentation that were outlined in the slides. As this is an exercise in documentation reading, please rely primarily on documentation and only secondarily on Stack Overflow

You will use MomentJS and a MomentJS plugin to make an exact age clock. Your finished product will look something like this:

## Bare Minimum Requirements

1. Read and understand index.html for context before diving in to documentation
    - Knowing what problem you're trying to solve will help guide you through the docs
2. Utilize the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) and [moment-precise-range plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment-precise-range) documentation. **Use Stack Overflow as a BACKUP and not a default**.

## Getting Started

1. ```npm install``` from the root directory
2. You should not need to edit any files other than index.html
